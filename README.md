Packages for compliant motion under force control of an ABB IRB 120 arm. ABB's EGM is used for its low latency. 
Multiple "behaviors" of the arm are being developed, for example, move until touch, peg in hole
Simultaneously, different control algorithms for achieving compliance are being tested, currently under accommodation control
